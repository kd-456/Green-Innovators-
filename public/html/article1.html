                <h2>How to Grow Carrots</h2>
                <p>Home-grown carrots have plenty of flavour, and there's a much wider variety of carrots to grow at
                    home than anything you can buy in the shops. As well as the standard orange carrot, you can also
                    grow purple, yellow, and white carrots, along with rounded carrots that are best suited to
                    growing
                    in pots.</p>
                <p>Growing carrots is straightforward as long as you prepare the soil well, ward off carrot root fly
                    and
                    grow the right variety for your needs and growing space. And, if you sow successionally and
                    learn
                    how to store your carrots, you can enjoy this delicious home-grown crop for nearly 12 months of
                    the
                    year.</p>

                <h3>How to Grow Carrots</h3>
                <p>Sow carrot seed sparingly in drills in prepared soil from March to June. Cover with a thin layer
                    of
                    sieved soil and water with a watering can with a rose attached. Carrot seeds should germinate
                    within
                    a couple of weeks. It's best to avoid thinning carrots to avoid carrot root fly, but keep the
                    area
                    weed free and water only in very dry spells. Carrots can take up to three months to grow –
                    depending
                    on the variety you choose, you should be harvesting fresh carrots around 10-16 weeks after
                    sowing.
                    There are two types of carrot to choose from – early varieties, which are sown in spring and are
                    ready to harvest about 10 weeks later, and late varieties, which can be sown from the end of
                    spring
                    and are ready to lift after about 14-16 weeks.</p>
                <p>When to plant carrots depends on your growing space and the materials you have to hand. The main
                    carrot sowing season is late March to June, but earlier and later sowings can be achieved by
                    sowing
                    in a greenhouse or polytunnel, or on soil that has been pre-warmed beneath horticultural fleece
                    or a
                    cloche.</p>

                <h3>Soil Preparation</h3>
                <p>Good soil preparation is essential. Fork it thoroughly to break up lumps and remove as many
                    stones as
                    possible. Carrots thrive in light, well-drained but moisture-retentive soil but can 'fork' if
                    the
                    nutrient value of the soil is too high. For this reason, it's best not to add organic matter to
                    the
                    soil the year you use it for growing carrots – add organic matter the year before, instead.</p>
                <p>If growing carrots in the soil, sow seed directly. Make a seed drill (shallow trench) about 1cm
                    deep
                    using the edge of a hoe or trowel. Sow the seeds thinly along the bottom of the drill about
                    5-8cm
                    apart – be careful not to grow carrots too close together as this can stunt their growth. Cover
                    the
                    seed with a thin layer of sieved soil, and water well using a watering can with a rose attached.
                </p>
                <p>To extend your cropping period, sow seeds successionally at two-week intervals. Sow a selection
                    of
                    carrot varieties that will crop at different times over the season.</p>

                <h3>Growing Carrots in Containers</h3>
                <p>Carrots do well in containers – indeed, carrots can be difficult to grow in heavy or stony soil,
                    so
                    they can do better in containers than in the ground. Your carrot planter can be anything from a
                    30cm
                    terracotta pot to an old recycling bucket; you can even buy bespoke carrot planters specifically
                    for
                    the job. Most carrots need a depth of around 30cm to grow, so a container with a minimum depth
                    of
                    30cm is ideal. However, you can choose round-rooted or dwarf carrot varieties for shallow
                    containers, or remember to harvest longer types early so they don't reach the bottom of the pot.
                </p>
                <p>Fill your carrot planter with sifted garden soil or a loam-based compost such as John Innes No.
                    2.
                    Water the compost first and allow it to drain, and then sow carrot seeds thinly, covering
                    lightly
                    with sieved soil.</p>
                <p>Carrots in containers don't need much more attention than those growing in the ground but you
                    will
                    need to water them more often, especially in dry weather. To prevent carrot root fly you can
                    simply
                    cover the whole container with horticultural fleece, weighing it down so the fly can't access
                    the
                    carrot plants to lay her eggs. When harvesting carrots, water the compost first to soften it,
                    which
                    will make pulling the carrots out easier.</p>

                <h3>Caring for Your Carrot Crop</h3>
                <p>Carrots don’t require too much care. Aim to keep the soil around them weed-free, although once
                    they
                    start to grow strongly, their foliage will shade out most weeds. Water occasionally – you want
                    the
                    roots to grow long so too much watering will result in stunted growth because the roots will get
                    everything they need near the soil's surface.</p>
                <p>Carrots that are flowering are a sign that the crop has bolted, often because of unseasonably
                    warm
                    weather. You can either leave the flower to provide food for bees and other pollinators or
                    remove
                    the plant from your row, but the carrot will no longer be edible once the plant has flowered.
                </p>
                <p>To prevent your crop from bolting, grow in a spot that doesn't get full sunshine during the heat
                    of
                    the day, and water when temperatures start to increase.</p>
                <p>Thinning out carrot seedlings not only wastes time, but it can also attract carrot root fly
                    because
                    they will detect the smell of crushed foliage when you pull the carrot seedlings up. Carrot
                    flies
                    lay their eggs in the soil around carrot plants. The larvae then burrow into the carrot roots,
                    eating and defecating in them.</p>
                <p>Sowing thinly is therefore better than thinning after sowing, but if you do need to thin your
                    carrots, don't worry. Here, Monty Don explains how to thin carrots while deterring carrot root
                    fly:
                </p>

                <h3>Pests and Flies</h3>
                <p>Carrot fly is the most common and serious problem associated with growing carrots. The fly's
                    maggots
                    eat tunnels through the roots, ruining the crop. Choose resistant carrot varieties such as
                    'Resistafly', 'Flyaway' or 'Syrtan'. Alternatively, place a 45cm-high fine-mesh barrier around
                    crops
                    or cover with fleece or a similar material. Alternating a row of carrots with a row of companion
                    plants like onions or garlic may help to mask their smell.</p>

                <h3>How to Harvest Carrots</h3>
                <p>Lift carrots when the soil is moist, or water beforehand, so they don't break apart when you pull
                    them. Water the soil again to settle it around the remaining roots.</p>

                <h3>How to Save Carrot Seeds</h3>
                <p>As biennials, carrots flower and set seed in their second year. Seed production is an
                    energy-intensive process and the carrot plant draws on carbohydrates stored in its root – this
                    means
                    the carrot is no longer edible once the plant has started to produce seeds.</p>
                <p>If you grow open-pollinated (not F1) carrot varieties you can leave a few to flower and set seed,
                    saving you the need to buy fresh carrot seeds the following year. In milder regions of the UK
                    simply
                    leave your carrots in the ground, mulching around the base of the plants to protect them from
                    frost.
                    The foliage will die back but will then regrow in spring, and then flowers and seeds will form.
                </p>
                <p>In colder areas, dig up your carrots in autumn, remove the foliage and store them in a clamp. You
                    can
                    then replant them in spring to sprout new leaves, flowers and seeds.</p>
                <p>Keep an eye on your carrot flowers and snip off the whole head when they become brown and dry.
                    Continue to dry the seedheads undercover (such as in your shed or greenhouse) until completely
                    dry,
                    and then use your hands to separate them from the plant.</p>
                <p>You can sieve the seeds to remove any chaff (spent foliage and stems) but it's not strictly
                    necessary
                    for germination. Once harvested, carrot seed can last for up to three years.</p>
                <p>Bear in mind that carrots can cross-pollinate with wild carrot (Daucus carota), which has small,
                    thin, white roots. It's virtually impossible to isolate your crop from wild carrot (a distance
                    of
                    around 500m is recommended), so keep an eye out for white roots when you come to harvest your
                    carrots, and ensure you don't save the seed of these.</p>
